Agenda for RSE4DataScience18
============================

The is an [Unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference)

We will crowd-source our topics for discussion in an agile fashion.

These will be discussed in a number of parallel sessions, with
feedback returned to the whole group.

We will then work towards
delivering a number of our outputs as [Speed Blogs]() within a few
days of the conference.

As an unconference, the following agenda is subject to 
amendment by the the delegates at any time.

Delegates will begin the conference with lightning talks:
* Two slides
* Slide one: Ninety Seconds on yourself, who you are, and your perspectives.
* Slide two: Ninety seconds on an idea you have at the intersection of research software engineering and data science

We will then discuss potential content for the breakout teams,
and who will join them. This will be 

Some parallel sessions will cover *technical* output: exemplars of ideas and tools
that could become larger projects. (Outputs could be in the form
of a jupyter notebook demonstrating a potential technology idea for development.)

Some parallel sessions will cover *political* output: thoughts
and ideas in the future of how RSE for Data Science should be done,
the nature of the roles, and so on. Outputs will be in the form
of position paper blogs.
